Gatling Gun
===========

Gatling Gun is a library that helps you blast out a group of emails.  It's a
simple wrapper over
[SendGrid's Newsletter API](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/newsletter-api/).

Install
-------

If you want to use this code in a Rails application, just add it to your
Gemfile:

    gem "gatling_gun"

To use the code in a non-Rails application, first install the gem:

    gem install gatling_gun

Then require the library in your code:

    require "gatling_gun"

Either way, you will want to setup Gatling Gun as your application loads.  I
recommend just setting a constant you can then refer to throughout your
application.  In Rails, I would put the following code in
`config/initializers/gatling_gun.rb`.  Setup is easy, just add you SendGrid
credentials:

    SendGrid = GatlingGun.new("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")

Usage
-----

The minimal steps to create and send a newsletter would be something like the
following.  First, you need an identity to send from:

    SendGrid.add_identity( "test", :name    => "Test User",
                                   :email   => "test@subinterest.com",
                                   :address => "513 Cinnamon Dr.",
                                   :city    => "Edmond",
                                   :state   => "OK",
                                   :zip     => "73003",
                                   :country => "USA" )

Then you can create a newsletter using that identity:

    SendGrid.add_newsletter( "episode1", :identity => "test",
                                         :subject  => "Episode 1",
                                         :text     => "The Text Body",
                                         :html     => "<h1>The HTML Body</h1>" )

Next you need to create a list of recipients, add some emails to it, and attach 
that list to the newsletter:

    SendGrid.add_list("subscribers")
    SendGrid.add_emails( "subscribers", [ { :name  => "James Edward Gray II",
                                            :email => "james@graysoftinc.com" },
                                          { :name  => "Admin",
                                            :email => "admin@graysoftinc.com" } ] )
    SendGrid.add_recipients("episode1", "subscribers")

Of course, you could reuse identities and recipient lists for future newsletter
messages without needing to recreate them.

Finally, you can schedule when to have the message sent:

    SendGrid.add_schedule("episode1", :at => Time.now + 10 * 60)

That would sent it 10 minutes from now, but you can adjust the time to whenever
you desire or even leave it out to send now.
